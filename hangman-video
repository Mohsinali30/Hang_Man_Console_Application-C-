# Project Walkthrough Video

I've uploaded a video that explains how my Hangman project works, including the tools and techniques I used.
  In the video, I go over the key features, the flow of the game, and how the project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and more.

This project is designed to help solidify OOP concepts in C++ through practical implementation in a fun and interactive game. 
Be sure to watch the video for a detailed explanation of the code structure and game mechanics.
