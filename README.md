# Hang_Man_Console_Application-C-

This is a simple console-based Hangman game developed in C++. It allows two players to enjoy the classic game of guessing a hidden word. One player inputs the word, and the other tries to guess it letter by letter within seven attempts. The game includes additional features like hints, changing player names, and viewing game instructions.

# Features:
Two-player mode: Players take turns entering words and guessing them.
Player scoring: Keeps track of the scores for both players.
Hints: Players can provide hints to make the guessing easier.

# How to Play

The game starts with a main menu where players can choose an option.
To play, Player 1 enters a word and provides a hint, while Player 2 guesses the word one letter at a time.
Player 2 has 7 lives to guess the word. Each incorrect guess brings the Hangman closer to completion.
If Player 2 successfully guesses the word, they win, and the score is updated. If all 7 lives are lost, Player 2 loses the round.
The players then switch roles, and the game continues.
